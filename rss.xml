            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>DAVID CERWONKA</h1><p>David, his wife and two dogs moved to the Arts District in
2006. He was immediately drawn to the district's unique mixture of people, art,
culture and local business. As a lifelong musician he’s come to appreciate and
understand the importance and need for creativity and encourages others to
follow their passion. As a business owner since moving to the district he’s
come to observe the diversity, growth and changes in real time. His company,
Walk Fido uniquely places him to feel the pulse of the Arts District and the
entire downtown area. His goal is to continue the tradition of outside the box
thinking that has kept the district unique and unlike any other part of Los
Angeles.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2d7f897a4fed983ac5fecb0f2d8b6fd3844fcacb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
