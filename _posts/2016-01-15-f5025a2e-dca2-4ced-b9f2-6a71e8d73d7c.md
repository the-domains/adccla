Working with other Arts District Community Organizations the Arts District Community Council supports and supplements all community efforts that beautify and transform the neighborhood including tree planting, tree trimming and maintenance.  Partnering with other community organizations, our board members have been active participants in the planting of trees in the neighborhood and want to continue and expand on those efforts. We believe that amazing things can happen when people work together.
