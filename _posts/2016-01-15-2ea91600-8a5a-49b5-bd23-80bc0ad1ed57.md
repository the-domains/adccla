Big things coming to the neighborhood...In just the next two years, two large public developments will be coming to the neighborhood.  Lakretz Park, scheduled to open in early 2016 and the 6th St Bridge replacement.  The Arts District Community Council will be at the forefront of making sure that the Arts Districts interests are protected and preserved.
